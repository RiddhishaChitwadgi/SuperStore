# Superstore Sales Analysis

This project is designed to load a dataset containing superstore sales data, process it using Python's `pandas` library, and connect to a database using `SQLAlchemy` for further analysis and manipulation.

## Project Overview
This project provides basic data loading and database connection functionality. The dataset is loaded using `pandas`, and `SQLAlchemy` is used to establish a connection to a database for potential storage and further analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset is assumed to be a CSV file named `superstore_train.csv`, located in the `Dataset` directory. This file contains sales data, including various fields related to transactions, such as sales, order date, discounts, and more.

## Installation
To set up the project, you need to install the required Python libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Use the following steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
After setting up the environment, you can run the Python script to load the dataset and establish a database connection. Here’s an example of how to use the script:

1. Place the `superstore_train.csv` dataset in the `Dataset` directory.
2. Modify the script to configure your database connection (if needed).
3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python your_script.py
    ```

The script will load the dataset into a `pandas` DataFrame and prepare it for database operations using SQLAlchemy.
